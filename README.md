# MLTools_w_UI
This is adapting knowledge from Kaggle Learn certificates and making it with a UI and heavy code documentation; making it more user-centered.

The ultimate goal is to make ML tools where interacting with the parameters and keeping track of them aren't difficult by creating some form of a UI to adjust parameters efficiently and decrease the time needed to get to model training.

Models will include:

Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Sequential Models (ReLU)
Image Classification
